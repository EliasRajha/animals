The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.

Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from the eastern coast of Russia down to parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia. However, over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and now are mainly found in a fragmented range stretching from India to Southeast Asia, and in Sumatra. There are an estimated 3,900 wild tigers left in the world, with the majority in India.
