# Dolphin

![Dolphin](../images/dolphin.jpg)

Dolphins are aquatic mammals within the infraorder Cetacea. The two extant families of dolphins are the Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins) and the Platanistoidea (the river dolphins). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10 t (11 short tons) killer whale. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible or agile as seals, some dolphins can travel at 29 km/h (18 mph) for short distances. Dolphins use their conical-shaped teeth to capture fast-moving prey.

They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water, and it is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water. Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals.
